# balanced-binary-tree

Given a binary tree, this program will determine if it is height-balanced. A Heigh binary tree is defined as:
```a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1. ```

## Examples 

Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
Return true.

Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:
```
       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
 ```
 Return false.
